                Our modular container-based Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are designed for scalable deployment
                up to utility scale. The modular architecture reduces installation time, optimizes transportation,
                and simplifies on-site handling, supporting faster deployment and flexible capacity expansion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ion Green delivers integrated solutions covering BESS, Energy Management Systems (EMS), grid-scale
                storage, and solar power EPC for utility, commercial, industrial, and residential applications.
                Systems are engineered to support grid stability, renewable integration, peak load management, and
                backup power.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our broader technology portfolio includes hybrid solar systems, hydrogen fuel cell technologies,
                EV energy infrastructure, and advanced battery and fuel-cell solutions for mobility and unmanned
                platforms.
              </p>
              <p>
                All systems are designed with due consideration to international standards and certification pathways,
